Information here provided can be used to reproduce the results in the paper "Facility layout analysis of an inland container terminal". 

The optimal layout of a road terminal can be obtained by running the following script:

	* Road_to_road_Facility_Layout

The optimal layout of an intermodal terminal (with parallel or perpendicular configuration) can be obtained by running the following scripts:

	* Parallel_Layout_Intermodal_Terminal
	* Perpendicular_Layout_Intermodal_Terminal

The optimal layout of an intermodal terminal with a single block parallel to rail tracks and with single access bays can be obtained by running the following script:

    * Single_Block_Parallel_Layout_Intermmodal_Terminal

Note that each script allows the adjustment of the parameters so that any practical instance may be solved.

Finally, consider that the folder must be placed on the disk C on windows; otherwise, you have  to change the path in every .m file.
